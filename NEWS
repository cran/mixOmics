  only the X variables

- New function: 'nearZeroVar' for identification of zero- or near-zero variance predictors 


Changes in 2.8-1
================

New features:
-------------
- New arguments ("axis.labelX", "axis.labelY") in the function imgCor, to indicate if the labels 
  of axis have to be shown or not

- New classes splsda and plsda for predict, print, plotIndiv, plot3dIndiv, plotVar, plot3dVar

- Several prediction functions are avaiable to predict the classes of test data with plsda and 
  splsda see predict (argument 'method' ("class.dist", "centroids.dist", "Sr.dist", "max.dist"))

- New functions map & unmap borrowed from the mclust package
